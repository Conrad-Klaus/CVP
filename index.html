<h2>ACHIEVEMENTS & EDUCATION</h2>

  <li><b>PROJECTS FINANCED BY EU WHERE PARTICIPATED</b><br>
    <a href="https://www.enhems-buildings.fer.hr/en/enhems-buildings">ENHEMS-BUILDINGS</a>  <br>
    <p>We delivered all the technology needed to make that project successful. My responsibility was to check installed infrastructure in the building, propose the system, write RFQ, and after the project started to install all the systems. The project was successful, and there were not issues connected with our part of the work, which happens mostly because of me.
